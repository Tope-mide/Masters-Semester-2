In 2008 more teams had joined so Give ‘n’ Go was formed to run the new leagues. It has grown now to 84 teams and counting, raising and donating hundreds of thousands of euro in that time.

Contrary to an athlete’s competitive spirit, their philanthropic journey along the Causeway is not a race. Each athlete proceeds at their own pace as Athletes for Hope guides them every step of the way.
 
 Education is at the core of Athletes for Hope and the beginning of every charitable athlete’s philanthropic journey. As part of our Causeway program, we have developed a curriculum of thought-provoking educational workshops for athletes of all levels. Through facilitated debate and reflection, the Athletes for Hope model helps athletes explore their role in the community, discover their philanthropic passions, and learn how to maximize their charitable impact through a broad range of options, including forming a foundation. In 2023, we expanded our offerings to Mental Health Team Talks and working with kids in the youth sports space.

Identifying the cause you care about is a personal and introspective process. Many athletes are unclear about what specific cause or what types of involvement they will find most fulfilling and allow them to have the greatest impact. At this stage we work with athletes to help them reflect on what matters most to them and guide them on taking the first steps. Once an athlete has identified a cause or causes that they care about, it’s time to explore which organization fits their needs. We identify and vet charitable organizations and help create experiences that align with an athlete’s interests and charity’s needs. We encourage athletes to begin their involvement by working with a variety of charities to gain a broader perspective about the causes they care about.",www.athletesforhope.org
The U.S. Center for Mental Health & Sport,"At the U.S. Center for Mental Health & Sport, we are focused on making sport environments a place where all involved can experience support for their mental health. We all have mental health and we should never be ashamed to talk about it or get the support we need. Mental health falls along a continuum and the mental health we experience can change throughout our lives. Whether individuals' mental health is thriving or languishing, the USC-MHS has the resources, training and support to help make the sport environment one that is inclusive and provides a positive experience! In order to establish sport environments that promote and support positive mental health, it is important for participants struggling with mental health issues to be surrounded by people who are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental health disorders, are able to provide basic information to those individuals regarding what they may be experiencing, and can direct those individuals toward the pathways for receiving additional support so they can recover. Our mental health awareness training is different from that offered anywhere else because we also focus on the special mental health risk factors and protective factors that are present in a sport environment. We all know that athletes' physical wellbeing is important. But do we also recognize that overall health includes mental health? At the USC-MHS we provide training for coaches on what coaching behaviors and initiatives support the mental health of athletes. All of our recommended practices for sports coaches are evidence-based and developed utilizing the latest research. This training goes beyond the basic mental health awareness training that focuses primarily on sign and symptoms of mental health disorders and takes a deeper dive into the behaviors that are instrumental in the prevention of mental health disorders. Establishing a mental health supporting environment in sports means that we look beyond just the athletes and support EVERYONE involved. We provide training and resources that pertain to the mental health of coaches, officials, parents, administrators, and anyone else included in our sports organizations. We know that there are specific risk factors associated with sport for mental health issues. However, it may be difficult to find a support group in the community-at-large that can truly understand those risk factors and some of the different challenges that individuals must work through in a sport environment. We provide group counseling / therapy sessions with a licensed mental health care providers who also have a great deal of experience in sport. These sessions are designed so that you can apply what you learn directly to your roll in sports. In order to support all of the initiatives listed above, we have a team of research fellows and mental health experts that allow us to bring the latest and best practices and mental health support mechanisms to you.

Participants attending the sessions typically feel a real sense of belonging and self worth and this helps in their road to recovery. There are clear exit strategies; CTF staff will support services users to engage in social inclusion activities of their choice (volunteering, education/training, leisure interests or work). We have had many success stories with our participants attending the project for a variety of reasons. Most want to improve their fitness and health, make more friends or achieve a vocational goal. The benefits of the project and the positive impact it has had on participants’ lives can be seen in the following short film and case study, Luke’s story shows how one young man who experienced depression and chronic anxiety used Coping Through Football as part of his recovery journey.",www.copingthroughfootball.org

The Changing Room,"The Changing Room is the psychotherapy practice of Dermot Heslin, offering individual counselling sessions in Dublin city and online. We aim to provide a safe and non-judgemental space to work through difficulties and challenges. I work with a broad range of issues such as depression, anxiety, grief, relationship issues, childhood trauma, self-esteem and personal-development. In The Changing Room, we see psychotherapy as a collaboration between therapist and client, as both spend time working together to resolve challenges in the client’s life. 

Psychotherapy provides a safe space (either in-person or online) where you can share your difficulties in a non-judgemental way. It can be difficult to get a neutral outsider’s perspective when talking with family-members or friends, and psychotherapy gives the possibility of this perspective.

I know that it can be very difficult to take the first step in seeking help. You can contact me here, to arrange a free 15 minute call to discuss how we might work together.",https://www.thechangingroom.ie/

Sport in Mind,"Sport in Mind ® is an award winning mental health charity (unaffiliated to Mind and not part of the local Mind network) that was formed in Reading, Berkshire in 2010 with a simple mission:
""To improve the lives of people experiencing mental health problems through sport and physical activity""
We are the UK’s leading mental health sports charity and deliver physical activity (sport, walking, dance and movement, gardening and exercise sessions) projects in partnership with the amazing NHS in order to aid recovery, promote mental wellbeing, improve physical health, combat social isolation and empower people to move their lives forward in a positive direction.
We've seen firsthand the positive impact physical activity can have on people's mental health having supported the recovery of thousands of people each year (sporty people and people who say they've never previously liked sport). We believe there's a sport or physical activity out there for everyone and Sport in Mind's aim is to ensure every single person in the country has the opportunity to improve their mental health through a physical activity session they enjoy.
Our Work
Sport in Mind's innovative programmes are delivered in partnership with the NHS and are co-designed by people with personal experience of mental health problems and healthcare professionals. We deliver sessions to support the recovery of people living with mental health problems in the community and inpatient care as we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to take part in sport and physical activity irrespective of how unwell they are. In addition to delivering physical activity programmes to improve the lives of people experiencing mental health problems, Sport in Mind also educates people about mental illness and the benefits of being physically active. Sadly, there are still many common misconceptions about mental illness in society today and we use the power of sport to bring people together to talk about mental health and help change attitudes. Due to the impact our work has had on the communities we operate in, Sport in Mind has gained national and international acclaim. In 2019, our charity received the highest honour a UK charity can be bestow - the Queen's Award for Voluntary Services.",https://www.sportinmind.org/

Because it’s not always a level playing field. Right now, the opportunities to get involved in sport and activity – and reap the rewards of being active – depend too much on your background, your gender, your bank balance and your postcode.

We’re determined to tackle this and unlock the advantages of sport and physical activity for everyone.

This isn’t just about our long-standing purpose of helping more people to enjoy playing sport and being physically active. We believe that by removing existing barriers to sport and activity, we can be part of a bigger picture of work that helps to address many of society’s biggest challenges.

Uniting the Movement is our 10-year strategy for 2021-31 aiming to do just that.

Together, we can change lives for the better in every home, and in every community, right across the country.

Equimetrics,"Despite their size, horses are surprisingly delicate animals, requiring frequent health checks and constant supervision. They are prone to numerous health conditions and adverse events that can prove to be life threatening. Colic is the number 1 killer of horses. Virtually any horse is susceptible to colic regardless of age, sex or breed, and there is no obvious cause. The prevalent types of colic vary from region to region due to environmental factors such as soil and climatic stress. However, the pathology is the same, with surgery frequently being required. The goal with any equine condition, is to spot any warning signs early.

Horses are creatures of habit, one of the primary indicators of any problem is to see the horse engaging in uncharacteristic behaviour.

Our solution provides a remote monitoring system that tracks equine health and provides early warning detection.
- Spot health issues, before they develop.
- Take the guess work out of equine care.
- Safeguard owners’ investment.

The solution consists of a patent protected equine vest incorporating various sensors to measure key biometric data:
- Motion
- Temperature
- Heart Rate
- Respiration
- Skin Impedance

This data will be transmitted to the cloud.
Using machine learning and predictive analytics we will be able to flag any deviations from normal physiology or behaviour giving early warning to owners and ultimately be able to predict adverse events before they even begin to manifest.

The final component will be a monitoring app. This provide users with a secure method of tracking their horses, and will alert them to any issues as soon as they are identified.http://www.frontend.com/",https://www.equimetrics.ie/
